- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Scott! A long time ago I worked as a software engineer at Boeing. Since that time I've been on a bit of a journey...attending law school, working as an attorney, a math teacher, and as a small business owner. I've come full circle now, and I'm trying to restart my career as a software engineer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in getting proficient in coding again - I earned a B.S. in Math & Computer Science, but from the ancient time known as 2005.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#/.NET (barely existed when I was first learning to code) and git/github
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: personal email address is sts dot cardsfan AT gmail dot com
